RotaCloud tech test

This is a tech test I did for a local company 'Rotacloud'.

It said to spend 2 hours on it so that is exactly what I spent. At least I didn't have to set up
my own data source in those 2 hours, I suppose that's a point in Rotaclod's favour.

They didn't bother with any feedback and never even had the courtesy to reply. I was left feeling
like tey didn't really care and that I'd wasted my time applying to them.
